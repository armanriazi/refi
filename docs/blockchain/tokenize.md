Tokenized carbon assets can be traded on a secondary market, ensuring a price mechanism for [[CO2]]. That enables for example asset managers and companies to incorporate carbon offsets directly into their offerings [4].

Tokenization can aid the voluntary carbon market in a range of ways, including by increasing liquidity and accessibility. Buyers and sellers can more easily trade credits, which can help to increase demand for credits and reduce volatility in the market. Tokenization can also help to reduce transaction costs and provide faster settlement times. The use of blockchain technology also increases transparency and tracking: it allows for the creation of a permanent, immutable record of all transactions, thereby enhancing the VCM’s credibility, as it provides a clear record of the history of each carbon credit. It can also help to reduce the risk of fraud and ensure that carbon credits are properly accounted for [11].

## Carbon offset solution

In the recent years, tokenization of (physical) assets and the creation of a digital version that is stored on the blockchain gained more interest. By utilizing blockchain technology, *asset ownership can be tokenized*, which enables **fractional ownership, reduces intermediaries, and provides a secure and transparent ledger**. This not only increases liquidity but also expands access to previously **illiquid assets (like carbon offsets)**. The blockchain ledger allows for real-time settlement of transactions, increasing efficiency and reducing the risk of fraud. Additionally, tokens can be programmed to include certain rules and restrictions, such as limiting the number of tokens that can be issued or specifying how they can be traded, which can provide greater transparency and control over the asset [43].

### Increased Accessibility

Carbon markets become more accessible as tokenization removes geographical restrictions. Anyone across the world can purchase, trade, and retire tokenized carbon credits through digital platforms[44].

### Fractional Ownership

Each credit can be split into smaller tokenized units, allowing individuals with limited budgets to offset their footprint[44].

### Enhanced Liquidity

Tokens can be seamlessly traded on decentralized exchanges, eliminating intermediaries and reducing costs[44].

### Transparency

The blockchain provides an immutable record of a credit’s origins and ownership history, preventing double-counting or other fraud[44].

### Automation

Smart contracts automate credit issuance, payments, transfers, and retirement, streamlining the process[44].

### Price Discovery

Tokenization provides transparent pricing data, increasing market efficiency and competition.
