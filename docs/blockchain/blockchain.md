Blockchain can be used to create a variety of applications that can have a positive social and environmental impact [DeFi Talent Slides]:

- [x] **community-driven** **Universal Basic Income** economy where those who in need receive a regular,unconditional payments to meet everyone's basic needs.
- [x] **transparent and efficient** regenerative agriculture supply chain, connecting farmers directly to consumers and reducing waste.
- [x] **DeFi** applications which make financial services more accessible to people in developing countries and other underserved communities.


Without auditability and visibility into the supply chain, it is difficult for buyers to make informed
decisions. This is where blockchain technology could play a role, although systems that use
blockchain still rely on data from legacy systems and can be difficult for non-experts to audit and
understand. Many current verification bodies have opaque and outdated processes and have been
slow to integrate new technologies that could help scale the entire onboarding and verification
process. One result is that carbon buyers have a hard time determining the quality of the credits they
are purchasing, and so they manage reputational risk by hiring intermediaries, who drive up costs
and have no incentive to make changes and adopt emerging technologies. This stifles market activity
and makes it even harder to meet climate targets. The lack of a standardized terminology for
describing carbon credits makes it hard for potential buyers to compare credits from different
sources and confidently purchase without the help of intermediaries. The use of the term “token”
(rather than “credit”) in the blockchain industry has only added to the confusion and has raised
regulatory concerns [10].
Using technology-based data collection tools such as digital decentralized measurement, reporting and
verification (MRV), and making such data available in an open-source and human-readable format (e.g.
on a blockchain-based ledger with a non-technical interface), can resolve challenges associated with
trust, transparency and interoperability in current systems. This can lead to enhanced confidence in
the market, better and more seamless participation for both sellers and buyers and greater scale [10].

- [x] Ensure better use of emerging technologies

Technologies such as advanced remote sensing,artificial intelligence and machine learning and IoT sensors, incorporating auditable records written
by DLT, are examples of combining emerging technologies, tools and modelling to help achieve scale. For example, **blockchains and smart contracts can support MRV** as a coordinated and
repeatable effort across a diverse group of sensors and stakeholders [10].


- [x] Interoperability and transparency across exchanges and platforms

> Build for systems, not silos.
Open application programming interfaces (APIs) accessing blockchain data have the potential to improve verifiability, reduce transaction costs and, to a lesser degree, address the concerns of some
projects. While not a new trend, the availability of welldocumented and accessible public APIs is critical. As
industries – especially those that have been slower to adopt technology – undergo digital transformation,
accessible APIs play an important role in delivering transparency, connectivity and innovation [10].
Appropriate use of **smart contracts would minimize manual reconciliation efforts** between disparate systems by
creating machine-readable agreements and auditable tracking of credits throughout their life cycle [10].


## Carbon Market

<figcaption>Schematic overview of carbon trading on a blockchain versus a centralized platform [19]</figcaption>
</figure>

The top panel shows the simplified steps required for a [[carbon_trade]] to occur on a blockchain platform, whereby project owners create tokens for carbon-saving projects, which are then traded via the decentralized market. The middle and bottom panels illustrate the differences between carbon offsetting via centralized and blockchain platforms. The dashed border around brokers in the latter case indicates that they are not strictly necessary, but no current projects are observed with projects selling directly to customers [19].
