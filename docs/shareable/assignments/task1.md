!!! Arman Riazi from ReFi Talents Cohort on 25 Sep

I am thrilled to share my Session 1 assignment for ReFi Talents, where I've gained invaluable insights on blockchain, ESG, planetary boundaries, and social impact through research and engaging discussions with fellow ReFi talents! ????
I look forward to the future sessions and getting feedbacks!

We delved into the most important concepts related to "Regenerative Finance" (ReFi). It's especially intriguing how #ReFi projects can provide solutions for environmental, community, and social challenges.

?? These are my insights and reflections from the class. I hope they inspire and inform everyone!
