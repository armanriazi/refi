Arman Riazi from ReFi Talents Cohort on 2 Nov

I am thrilled to share my Session 1 assignment for ReFi Talents, where I've gained invaluable insights on blockchain, ESG, planetary boundaries, and social impact through research and engaging discussions with fellow ReFi talents!
I look forward to future sessions and getting feedback!
We delved into the most important concepts related to "Regenerative Finance" (ReFi). It's especially intriguing how #ReFi projects can provide solutions for environmental, community, and social challenges.
This course brings people to share their thoughts on how to do #Tokenization of #Carbon #Credits, #Nature as an #asset class a(NaaAC) , Personal Regeneration,#Blockchain Ecosystem Overview.
These are my insights and reflections from the class. I hope they inspire and inform everyone!
