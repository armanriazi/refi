“Whilst we didn’t turn the page on the fossil fuel era in Dubai, this outcome is the beginning of the end,” , “Now all governments and businesses need to turn these pledges into real-economy outcomes, without delay.” [57]

When you zoom out and look at all the new technologies coming online — AI, machine learning, remote sensors, blockchain, the list goes on — there’s just an incredible potential for unlocking new capital flows into verifiable climate action at scale.

Where do you envision the future of sustainable investments in five years [8]? 
Nadine Wilke: Predicting the future always poses a challenge, akin to gazing into a crystal ball. However, I am confident that the tokenization of real-world assets will continue to evolve. There are already studies suggesting that by 2030, *assets worth up to 16 trillion dollars* will be represented through tokenization, with blockchain serving as the underlying infrastructure. Presently, within the sustainability sector, we already have **25 asset classes** such as tokenized CO2 and tokens for renewable energy certificates. These also include Circular Economy, [[Supply_chain]] Traceability, and Water Credits. Established assets like rare earths, raw materials, and precious metals such as gold and silver are already being depicted and traded as their virtual counterparts, or “Digital Twins”. Ultimately, **any asset that can be quantified has the potential to be tokenized** [8]. #statistics
The insightful discussion with the ReFi specialist unveils: The marketplace for sustainable, digital assets is swiftly expanding and gaining more transparency. An amplified competitive environment, alongside the rise of FinTechs and technologies such as blockchain and AI, can play a substantial role in fostering trust in ReFi, and consequently, exert a positive long-term effect on climate protection [8].
One of the core instruments in doing that is redesigning money itself in a way that writes a new story for what it actually means to be an integral human being living on a shared planet. A story that encapsulates the values of caring, mutuality and human flourishing [5].
**Redesigning money requires understanding tokens (digital assets with a specific value) and tokenomics (token + economics)**, which makes visible and captures all the different forms and the **eight manifestations of capital*: 
*social, material, financial, living, intellectual, experiential, spiritual and cultural* [5].
