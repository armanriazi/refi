## What is the Doughnut?

Think of it as a compass for human prosperity in the 21st century, with the aim of meeting the needs of all people within the means of the living planet. The Doughnut consists of two concentric rings: **a social foundation**, to ensure that no one is left falling short on *lifeâ€™s essentials*, and **an ecological ceiling**, to ensure that humanity does not collectively overshoot the planetary boundaries that protect Earth's *life*-supporting systems*. Between these two sets of boundaries lies a doughnut-shaped space that is both ecologically safe and socially just: a space in which humanity can thrive. The Doughnut is the core concept at the heart of Doughnut Economics [40].
