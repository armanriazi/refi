Regenerative finance (ReFi) is a set of tools and ideas **built on top of blockchains**, that aim to create economies which are **regenerative, rather than extractive or exploitative**. 

Eventually, **extractive systems deplete the resources available and collapse; without regenerative mechanisms, they lack #resilience.** 

ReFi operates on the assumption that the **creation of monetary value must be decoupled from the unsustainable extraction of resources** from our planet and communities. One of the foundations of ReFi is the concept of regenerative economics **pioneered by John Fullerto** [1].

**ReFi also overlaps with the decentralized science (DeSci)** movement, which uses Ethereum as a platform to finance, create, review, credit, store, and disseminate scientific knowledge. DeSci tools could become useful for developing verifiable standards and practices for implementing and monitoring **regenerative activities like planting trees, removing [[plastic]] from the ocean, or [[restor]]ing a degraded ecosystem** [1].

## Values of ReFi

Instead, ReFi aims to **solve environmental, communal, or social problems** by creating regenerative cycles. These systems create value for participants while simultaneously benefiting ecosystems and communities [1].

## Behaviors of ReFi

ReFi projects realize these principles using smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications to incentivize regenerative behaviors, e.g. restoring degraded ecosystems, and **facilitate large-scale collaboration on global issues such as climate change and biodiversity loss** [1].
