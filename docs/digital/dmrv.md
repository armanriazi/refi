# Credit issuance

**Credit issuance is ultimately a process of (MRV)** monitoring, reporting, and verification: 
monitoring to calculate a projectâ€™s emissions reductions (i.e., credits), reporting to document the calculations before a credit registry, and verification of the calculations by independent auditors. Credit registries, such as **Verra**, now refer to future digital crediting platforms as digital MRV (DMRV) platforms. Since our founding in 2018, Pachama has sought to lead the way in DMRV and become the first registry-certified DMRV platform [29].

DMRV platforms would modernize credit issuance in at least 4 critical ways [29].

1. Shift from manual data collection **to satellite observation** [29].
2. Shift from inconsistent, manual calculation to uniform, **automated calculation** [29].
3. Shift from auditing projects to **certifying platforms** [29].
4. Shift from static documents to interactive, digital **visualization** [29].

# A Core Crediting Equation

To calculate each term in this equation, a DMRV must produce three core outputs: an estimate of baseline emissions, a map of forest carbon, and a map of forest cover change (deforestation and/or reforestation) to know where carbon has been lost or gained [29].
