## Digital transformation 

Digital transformation across the [[environment]] and [[climate]] sector is an urgent opportunity for meaningful action [2].

**Global climate infrastructure**, **tools** and **coordination technologies** are needed to keep pace with the changing planetary ecosystem, transcend borders and span social, economic, cultural and governmental domains. This is where blockchain can help [2].

Blockchain is one of several emerging technologies being explored to [[address]] **urgent environmental issues such as #biodiversity_loss, #disaster_displacement and #energy_grid_deficiencies, as well as #resource_allocation and coordination –all critical parts of this complex, intersectional,intergenerational and multicultural climate challenge. The defining qualities of blockchains – decentralized, open and global – make them powerful tools** that can provide breadth and depth to current climate mitigation and adaptation efforts [2].

Blockchain can #democratize ownership and reallocate resources to shift power dynamics to the people most knowledgeable of, and most #vulnerable to, the effects of climate change. Blockchain could also improve the #transparency and integrity of existing decarbonization mechanisms like [[carbon]] markets. When paired **with #digital_tools for #measurement, #reporting and #verification (#MRV)** – such as remote #sensors, #drone imagery and [[AI]] – digital environmental assets and carbon accounting systems can provide real-time visibility into the effectiveness of #emissions_reduction and sequestration efforts [2].

Blockchain adoption and implementation across #decarbonization sectors will require thoughtful coordination, meaningful action across layers of [[societ]]y and [[industr]]y, [[educa]]tion and balanced [[regula]]tion. #entrepreneurs and #investors will be betting on this space not existing in a vacuum [2].
