# Re-fungibility

Re-fungibility is an important step towards building real life models of ownership rights. Often a unique item may be owned by multiple entities in different proportions. The examples of such shared ownership are abundant: Timeshares, co-ownership of art, fractional car ownership, etc. For that purpose, Unique Network provides the special mode of Collection: Re-Fungible. The Re-fungible token can be minted and then partially transferred to multiple owners [17].

## Fungible collection mode
Fungible collection mode is targeted at the same set of use cases as ERC-20 tokens. Any non-unique and divisible resource can be represented as a Fungible token. While these use cases are not the prime focus of Unique Network, many applications need this functionality in parallel to the NFT the examples include: non-unique game resources  , rating points in applications with social networking capabilities, voting tokens, etc [17].
