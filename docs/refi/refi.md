Regenerative finance (ReFi) is a set of tools and ideas **built on top of blockchains**, that aim to create economies which are **regenerative, rather than extractive or exploitative**. 

Eventually, **extractive systems deplete the resources available and collapse; without regenerative mechanisms, they lack #resilience.** 

ReFi operates on the assumption that the **creation of monetary value must be decoupled from the unsustainable extraction of resources** from our planet and communities. One of the foundations of ReFi is the concept of regenerative economics **pioneered by John Fullerto** [1].

**ReFi also overlaps with the decentralized science (DeSci)** movement, which uses Ethereum as a platform to finance, create, review, credit, store, and disseminate scientific knowledge. DeSci tools could become useful for developing verifiable standards and practices for implementing and monitoring **regenerative activities like planting trees, removing [[plastic]] from the ocean, or [[restor]]ing a degraded ecosystem** [1].

## Values of ReFi

Instead, ReFi aims to **solve environmental, communal, or social problems** by creating regenerative cycles. These systems create value for participants while simultaneously benefiting ecosystems and communities [1].

## Behaviors of ReFi

ReFi projects realize these principles using smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications to incentivize regenerative behaviors, e.g. restoring degraded ecosystems, and **facilitate large-scale collaboration on global issues such as climate change and biodiversity loss** [1].

## Eight Principles of a regenerative economy

- [1] Edge effect abundance
- [2] Seeks balance
- [3] Empowered participation
- [4] Views wealth holistically
- [5] Innovative adaptive responsive
- [6] Robust circulation
- [7] Honors place & community
- [8] In right relationship

## Personal Regeneration

ReFi enables programming of incentives that lead to changed behaviour for the better of the planet – and empowers local communities to monetize stewardship of their natural capital and ecological assets – something we know is critical to ecosystem restoration and biodiversity protection [2].

From my perspective, the economy today is extractive, focused solely on GDP growth with little regard for externalities punishing people and the planet. ReFi challenges that by creating a financial structure where the economic activity has a positive impact on the ecosystem [2].
