Regenerative finance (ReFi) is a set of tools and ideas **built on top of blockchains**, that aim to create economies which are **regenerative, rather than extractive or exploitative [1]**. 

Regenerative finance (ReFi) is an alternative financial system that focuses on promoting and restoring sustainability and resilience along with monetary gains. It has found favor in the cryptocurrency ecosystem and is often used to describe a cryptocurrency project that uses its platform to invest in sustainability, including environmental, social, and financial stability and growth [16].

Eventually, **extractive systems deplete the resources available and collapse; without regenerative mechanisms, they lack #resilience [1].** 

ReFi operates on the assumption that the **creation of monetary value must be decoupled from the unsustainable extraction of resources** from our planet and communities. One of the foundations of ReFi is the concept of regenerative economics **pioneered by John Fullerto** [1].

**ReFi also overlaps with the decentralized science (DeSci)** movement, which uses Ethereum as a platform to finance, create, review, credit, store, and disseminate scientific knowledge. DeSci tools could become useful for developing verifiable standards and practices for implementing and monitoring **regenerative activities like planting trees, removing [[plastic]] from the ocean, or [[restor]]ing a degraded ecosystem** [1].

## Values of ReFi

Instead, ReFi aims to **solve environmental, communal, or social problems** by creating regenerative cycles. These systems create value for participants while simultaneously benefiting ecosystems and communities [1].

## Behaviors of ReFi

ReFi projects realize these principles using smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications to incentivize regenerative behaviors, e.g. restoring degraded ecosystems, and **facilitate large-scale collaboration on global issues such as climate change and biodiversity loss** [1].

## Eight Principles of a regenerative economy

- [1] Edge effect abundance
- [2] Seeks balance
- [3] Empowered participation
- [4] Views wealth holistically
- [5] Innovative adaptive responsive
- [6] Robust circulation
- [7] Honors place & community
- [8] In right relationship

### The eight principles describe [30]

#### Principle #1: In Right Relationship 

There is a growing momentum to see beyond shareholders’ value maximization. Corporations include Environment, Social and Governance measures in their Business Report.

#### Principle #2: Views Wealth Holistically

Wealth is beyond one just Financial goals; Perhaps it is a satisfying social network, access to parks and natural spaces, the ability to pursue curiosity and develop intellectually, or spiritual fulfilment.

#### Principle #3: Innovative, Adaptive, Responsive

To Solve problems creatively. Let us create Businesses that do that well are the ones that survive. Creative business models are often the best at not only solving challenging issues in a way but also benefiting local communities and the planet.

#### Principle #4: Empowered Participation

Decentralized leadership is a way to ensure everyone has a voice and buy-in to the company’s goals and empowers professional relationships. Support policies that are good for both people and the planet.

#### Principle #5: Honors Community and Place

Each human community consists of peoples, traditions, beliefs, and institutions uniquely shaped by long-term pressures of geography, human history, culture, local environment, and changing human needs. 

A Regenerative Economy nurtures healthy and resilient communities and regions, each uniquely informed by the essence of its individual history and place.”

#### Principle #6: Edge Effect Abundance

More diverse employees are more innovative, create more profits, and have more satisfied employees. Diversity in perspectives helps groups make informed decisions, lead to greater creativity, and fosters environments of respect. This business “edge effect” is a feature of more regenerative economic systems.

#### Principle #7: Robust Circulatory Flow

Nature is a cyclic, regenerative system in which each part serves a purpose. In Nature, there is no waste, and a fallen log becomes home to fungus and food for termites. Find ways to reduce or reuse “waste” in our own life or introduce them into our company.

#### Principle #8: Seeks Balance

Corporations should balance the profit motive with an equal emphasis on people and the planet. Business can be a force that helps social, ecological, and economic systems operate in a healthy balance. Balance is a theme that runs through each of the Regenerative Principles. Things work better when they are in balance.
Decentralized finance (DeFi) eliminates intermediaries by allowing people, merchants, and businesses to conduct financial transactions through Blockchain Technology.

## Sustainability vs Regenerative

Regenerative is **seeking strategies** for less harmful social and environmental practices (“do less bad”) to achieve competitive advantage rather than “doing more good.”.
Sustainable companies aim to maintain the current state of natural systems in the present: they focus on **reducing negative impact**, **preventing further degradation**, and conserving resources. Their efforts have an inherent limitation: they usually are concerned about making processes and products “more efficient,” **using fewer resources for each product produced**,

## Regenerative economics

Regenerative economics can be viewed as applying the **natural laws** and **patterns of systemic health, self-organization, self-renewal, and regenerative vitality** to socioeconomic systems [12].
Regenerative economics follows a holistic, systemic approach that **recognizes** the interconnectedness of all aspects of a system [12].
It can also help **identify** feedback loops, leverage points, and unintended consequences of specific actions or interventions.

For businesses redefining their value and purpose, new sets of metrics and KPIs will be required to monitor success. For proper
tracking and monitoring, accounting processes should also be adapted to include the social and
environmental cost of business activities—and be as stringent as they are for ‘traditional’ financial costs [13].

Analytic to Holistic (Systemic). Where most modern theories imagine economies are built of independent agents following rational self-interest, a Regenerative economics argues that economies
are actually built of interdependent specialists linked in common-cause networks. Healthy processing and circulation also requires the system’s interdependent specialists form a whole circuit, circularly-
connected value chains that link incoming resources and processing to final distribution and payment. Systemic health requires systemic design because whole circuits only work when all parts are healthy.
Here, **instead of the traditional emphasis on how much money is exchanged (GDP), regenerative practitioners focus on where money goes** and whether its impacts are constructive or destructive,
short-term or lasting [14].

## Personal Regeneration

ReFi enables programming of incentives that lead to changed behaviour for the better of the planet – and empowers local communities to monetize stewardship of their natural capital and ecological assets – something we know is critical to ecosystem restoration and biodiversity protection [2].
`CJ Hetherington, Co-Founder, Atlantis World`

From my perspective, the economy today is extractive, focused solely on GDP growth with little regard for externalities punishing people and the planet. ReFi challenges that by creating a financial structure where the economic activity has a positive impact on the ecosystem [2].

The Good Life Goals should be used as a communications and **educational tool** to engage the global public in the SDGs. Companies who support ‘sustainable lifestyles’ will also be invited to focus their efforts on how their work can **align with personal behavior**. The goals are created for individual action and will be used by brands, NGOs, and governments to engage their audiences effectively in influencing our collective sustainable development [15].
