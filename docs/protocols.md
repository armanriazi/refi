## Kyoto

While the Kyoto Protocol provided a framework for **reducing the greenhouse gas** emissions of industrialized nations, current climate change negotiations envisage future commitments for major co2 emitters among developing countries. This document uses an **updated version of the [[gtap]]-e** general equilibrium model to analyse the economic implications of reducing carbon emissions under different carbon trading scenarios [20].

> we formulate four primary scenarios [20]:

- [x] Kyoto Protocol without emissions trading (Kyontr),
- [x] Kyoto Protocol with emissions trading between Annex I countries (Kyotr),
- [x] Kyoto Protocol with emissions trading between Annex I countries and participation by some developing countries (Kyotr3 and Kyotrla),
- [x] Kyoto Protocol with worldwide emissions trading (Kyowtr).

The [[Kyoto]] Protocol has established three main market mechanisms for reducing greenhouse gases [20]:

- [x] international emissions trading among participating parties (Annex I countries) in the carbon market, where countries with emissions lower than their targets are able to sell those emissions to countries that are over their targets [20].
- [x] Joint Implementation, which allows Annex I countries to invest in projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions in other Annex I countries and have the credits generated by those projects count towards their emissions reduction commitment [20].
- [x] the Clean Development Mechanism, which allows Annex I countries to invest in emissions reduction projects in developing countries and have credits generated from those projects count towards their Kyoto Protocol commitments. The Kyoto Protocol and Marrakesh Accords established a system of emissions trading among 37 developed and transition economies that represented about 29% of all the world’s co2 emissions in 2004 (wri, 2008) [20].
