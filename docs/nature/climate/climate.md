## C4C

Capital for Climate (C4C) is accelerating capital deployment to climate solutions required to achieve a 1.5°C degree outcome. It provides an integrated offering, including a climate solution intelligence platform, hosted investor communities, and education and strategic advisory services. At COP26, in collaboration with the U.N.’s High-Level Climate Champions, C4C launched a free, public-purpose pilot version of their platform focused on Nature-based Solutions. Early funders include the Finance Hub of the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Quadrature Climate Foundation, Wells Fargo Foundation, and Climateworks Foundation.

## N4C 

Nature4Climate is a communications and advocacy platform that works to increase investment in and action on nature-based solutions. N4C is composed of 20 of the world’s leading conservation, multilateral, and business organizations and seeks to further catalyze partnerships between governments, civil society, businesses, and investors, based on the urgency to protect, restore, and fund nature-based solutions. N4C believes in the importance of integrating nature across all government decision-making, that NDCs can be greatly enhanced using nature-based solutions, and that finance flows to nature-based solutions need to be increased, and in many areas, reformed.
