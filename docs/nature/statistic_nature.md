## VCM
Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM) is now estimated at almost $2 billion. This number is up from $1 billion in 2021, $473 in 2020, and $320 in 2019.52 Now, with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement from COP26 set to further bolster the VCM, quality credits will be in even greater demand [9].
MRV tools make up only 3% of carbon removal venture funding at just $65 million [9].
The VCM is predicted to grow exponentially: from $2 billion in value in 2021 to $50 billion in 2030 [2].
