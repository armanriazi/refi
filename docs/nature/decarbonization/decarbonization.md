## Two Types Of Carbon Markets
Effective action will require concerted and sufficient investment, knowing also that the costs of inaction will be far higher. Developing countries will need up to US$6 trillion by 2030 to finance not even half of their climate action goals[17].
**The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)**, adopted under the *[[Kyoto]] [[Protocol]] in 1997*, is another well-known **example of an international compliance market**[17].
One type of compliance market that many people will have heard of are **emissions trading systems (ETS)**. **Operating on a “cap-and-trade” principle**, regulated businesses – or countries, as in the case of the European Union’s ETS – are issued emission/pollution permits, or allowances by governments (which add up to a total maximum, or capped, amount). Polluters that exceed their permitted emissions must buy permits from others with permits available for sale (i.e., trade)[17].

## What are carbon credits?

A forest [[carbon_credit]] is an **emissions reduction due to forest conservation or reforestation**
that would not have occurred without carbon crediting. The carbon emissions (or uptake in the case of reforestation) expected **in the absence of the project is called the baseline** [29]. At its simplest, 
> *credit issuance equals: baseline emissions minus project emissions [29].*

### Leakage

 We also have to **deduct emissions that “leak out” of the project**, because stopping deforestation in the project may cause some deforestation to just move elsewhere. This is called leakage. So total credit issuance can be reduced to a single core crediting equation [29].

## What are carbon markets?

In a nutshell, carbon markets are **trading systems** in which carbon credits are sold and bought. Companies or individuals can use carbon markets **to compensate** *for their greenhouse gas emissions by purchasing carbon credits* from entities that remove or reduce greenhouse gas emissions [17].
carbon markets can help accelerate the transformation needed, by effectively **putting a price on pollution** and **creating an economic incentive** for reducing emissions. They can also help generate some of the vast sums needed to build resilience [17].

**One tradable carbon credit equals one tonne of carbon dioxide** or the equivalent amount of a different greenhouse gas reduced, sequestered or avoided. When **a credit is used to reduce, sequester, or avoid emissions**, *it becomes an offset and is no longer tradable* [17].

Finally, it needs to be remarked that dynamic effects are not considered in this assessment, and the longterm incentives a carbon #tax may create for investment allocation around the world and among economic sectors, and changes in future competitiveness, remain a matter for future reseach. Winners and losers from a trading scheme might change depending on countries’ ability to adapt their economies in a dynamic context. Nevertheless, the short-term costs are low enough to justify action, and trading schemes that provided flexibility would be beneficial [20].

One of the major problems of carbon markets is the potential for fraud or double-counting of credits. By building [[ReFi]] on the blockchain a new form of transparency is introduced that would eliminate the possibility of the same credit being counted twice. On-chain carbon credits are #traceable and #immutable meaning that no two people are able to claim the same credit twice. Burning (or retiring) on-chain credits ensures that they cannot be used again. One company enabling carbon on-chain is Toucan Protocol [21].

## VCM
Voluntary carbon market: Where private individuals, corporations and other actors issue,
buy and sell carbon credits outside of regulated or mandatory carbon pricing instruments [2].
The voluntary carbon market (VCM) is an existing market mechanism that the global community
can use to channel enterprise capital into land conservation and environmental stewardship.
According to a recent McKinsey report, “Voluntary carbon credits direct private financing to climate
projects that would not otherwise get off the ground, and they support investment into innovation required
to lower the cost of emerging climate technologies” [2].

As the VCM has begun to scale up to meet growing corporate demand for carbon offsets to meet netzero
targets, transparency has become a concern. For carbon markets to deliver on their promise,
corporate buyers (and the general public) need to have confidence in their quality and integrity: carbon
offsets need to transparently demonstrate causal and durable change to GHG concentrations while proving they are free from credibility concerns like
double counting or leakage [2].

Due to their public, accessible and machinereadable format, blockchains can provide a
transparent foundation necessary for a trustworthy and scalable VCM. When carbon registries are
built on blockchain, market participants can view a transparent digital record of every credit across
[[geograph]]ies and standards, allowing global price and supply coordination. When paired with
digital tools for [[MRV]] – such as smart meters and sensors, drone imagery and data science – digital
carbon accounting systems can provide #real_time visibility into the actual effectiveness of ongoing
carbon sequestration efforts. Such [[transparen]]cy removes the risk for corporate buyers who want to
ensure their [[net_zero]] budgets are going towards measurable, verifiable climate mitigation efforts [2].

A fully digital VCM will demonstrate marketmaking and growth capabilities. Digitizing
the VCM is currently the leading use case for blockchain innovations in the climate space.
Key challenges such as market fragmentation,analogue reporting and verification procedures
leading to bottlenecks in credit issuance, and limited price discovery have stymied the growth of the VCM for over two decades [2].

The VCMI acknowledged the varied emission profiles of companies in different sectors and the diverse challenges and opportunities companies face in reaching their climate mitigation goals, as well as an uneven ability to pay for BVCM [11].

When considering long-term engagement in the VCM, it is recommended to take into account the following key factors [11]:

- [x] Your intent should be to engage with the VCM over and above your science-based within-value-chain carbon emission reductions [11].
- [x] You should accept that transparent, independent verification of your climate-related investments will be required [11].
- [x] You should accept that your advocacy activities will be aligned with the Global Standard on Responsible Corporate Lobbying [11].
