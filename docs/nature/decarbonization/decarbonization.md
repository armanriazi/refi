## VCM
Voluntary carbon market (VCM)50: Where private individuals, corporations and other actors issue,
buy and sell carbon credits outside of regulated or mandatory carbon pricing instruments [2].
The voluntary carbon market (VCM) is an existing market mechanism that the global community
can use to channel enterprise capital into land conservation and environmental stewardship.
According to a recent McKinsey report, “Voluntary carbon credits direct private financing to climate
projects that would not otherwise get off the ground, and they support investment into innovation required
to lower the cost of emerging climate technologies” [2].

As the VCM has begun to scale up to meet growing corporate demand for carbon offsets to meet netzero
targets, transparency has become a concern. For carbon markets to deliver on their promise,
corporate buyers (and the general public) need to have confidence in their quality and integrity: carbon
offsets need to transparently demonstrate causal and durable change to GHG concentrations while proving they are free from credibility concerns like
double counting or leakage [2].

Due to their public, accessible and machinereadable format, blockchains can provide a
transparent foundation necessary for a trustworthy and scalable VCM. When carbon registries are
built on blockchain, market participants can view a transparent digital record of every credit across
[[geograph]]ies and standards, allowing global price and supply coordination. When paired with
digital tools for [[MRV]] – such as smart meters and sensors, drone imagery and data science – digital
carbon accounting systems can provide #real_time visibility into the actual effectiveness of ongoing
carbon sequestration efforts. Such [[transparen]]cy removes the risk for corporate buyers who want to
ensure their [[net_zero]] budgets are going towards measurable, verifiable climate mitigation efforts [2].

A fully digital VCM will demonstrate marketmaking and growth capabilities. Digitizing
the VCM is currently the leading use case for blockchain innovations in the climate space.
Key challenges such as market fragmentation,analogue reporting and verification procedures
leading to bottlenecks in credit issuance, and limited price discovery have stymied the growth of the VCM for over two decades [2].

The VCMI acknowledged the varied emission profiles of companies in different sectors and the diverse challenges and opportunities companies face in reaching their climate mitigation goals, as well as an uneven ability to pay for BVCM [11].

When considering long-term engagement in the VCM, it is recommended to take into account the following key factors [11]:

- [x] Your intent should be to engage with the VCM over and above your science-based within-value-chain carbon emission reductions [11].
- [x] You should accept that transparent, independent verification of your climate-related investments will be required [11].
- [x] You should accept that your advocacy activities will be aligned with the Global Standard on Responsible Corporate Lobbying [11].
