## VCM
Voluntary carbon market (VCM)50: Where private individuals, corporations and other actors issue,
buy and sell carbon credits outside of regulated or mandatory carbon pricing instruments [2].
The voluntary carbon market (VCM) is an existing market mechanism that the global community
can use to channel enterprise capital into land conservation and environmental stewardship.
According to a recent McKinsey report, “Voluntary carbon credits direct private financing to climate
projects that would not otherwise get off the ground, and they support investment into innovation required
to lower the cost of emerging climate technologies” [2].
