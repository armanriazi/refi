Ecosapiens is focused on nature based carbon removal solutions. For the alpha, we are sourcing our carbon credits from Kenya Soil Carbon - an avoidance and removal solution [38].
As the first large, landscape-scale soil carbon project of its kind in the world, the Northern Kenya Rangelands Project improves grassland health of 1.9 million hectares of degraded savannah grasslands in northern Kenya impacted by changing climatic conditions, severe drought, and livestock overgrazing [38].
The Northern Kenya Rangelands project is one of only 16 projects worldwide certified to the Triple Gold Level under the Climate, Community and Biodiversity Alliance’s (CCBA) standards. The project is also certified under the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) from Verra, one of the sector’s leading and most respected carbon standards, using its sustainable grasslands methodology (VM0032) [38].
Upon upgrading the Chrysalis to the first Level, each Ecosapien will be infused with 16 tons of CO2 in the form of carbon credits sourced from Kenya Soil Carbon. Carbon infused in additional levels will also be sourced from Kenya Soil Carbon. As demand suits, we will expand and diversify the portfolio of carbon credits we offer Ecosapien holders [38].
