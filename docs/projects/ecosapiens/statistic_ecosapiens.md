Newly planned rotational grazing management is expected to restore overgrazed grasslands and improve soil carbon storage. This expected change in **soil carbon will remove more than 600,000 tons of greenhouse gas** (CO2 equivalents) from the atmosphere per year, doubling the carrying capacity of the land from its current value [38].
Moreover, **Kenya Soil Carbon serves 6 of the UNâ€™s 17 goals for sustainable development**. We are super excited by the impact this project has on the local economy and impact beyond carbon removal [38].
As the series of collections and other digital goods expands, we will expand the portfolio of climate projects to include other types of nature-based credits such as forestry and kelp [38].
