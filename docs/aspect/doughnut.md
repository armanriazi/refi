## What is the Doughnut?

Think of it as a compass for human prosperity in the 21st century, with the aim of meeting the needs of all people within the means of the living planet. The Doughnut consists of two concentric rings: **a social foundation**, to ensure that no one is left falling short on *life’s essentials*, and **an ecological ceiling**, to ensure that humanity does not collectively overshoot the planetary boundaries that protect Earth's *life*-supporting systems*. Between these two sets of boundaries lies a doughnut-shaped space that is both ecologically safe and socially just: a space in which humanity can thrive. The Doughnut is the core concept at the heart of Doughnut Economics [40].

The focus on scarce resources has led many people to see endless growth as a positive, or “more is better”. However, in reality, **economic growth is measured only by an increasing GDP, completely ignoring the finite nature of Earth’s resources and the consequences of our actions** [41].

Doughnut Economics is based on an economy that is both regenerative and distributive by design.
The ultimate goal of this framework is to enable societies to make positive choices and *live in balance in order to thrive economically, socially, and environmentally*. This new economic vision cannot be achieved by an individual or a single organisation. Rather, it requires intention, planning, collaboration, and contributions from all stakeholders. What the doughnut offers is a metaphor that helps us visualise an economic system [41].
