# The MiCA Law 

The MiCA Law or Law for Cryptoactive Markets, is a new EU regulation focused on offering a **common regulatory framework** for the entire **financial ecosystem** that revolves around blockchain and cryptocurrencies. In short, we are facing what would be the beginning of a truly correct regulation for the crypto space, which would also make the rules of the game very clear for users, service providers and other entities related to the world of tokens and cryptocurrencies [47].

The MiCA Law is the first comprehensive regulation for cryptocurrencies in the EU. Approved on October 10, 2022, the body of the Law consists of more than 100 articles that **address issues** such as *money laundering, KYC, consumer and investor protection, the responsibility of cryptocurrency companies and stablecoins* [47].

the Law establishes a global framework that sets the requirements for the operation and governance of the **main issuers of** *crypto assets and CASP service providers (Contracted Application Service Provider or Contracted Application Service Provider)*. It also makes clear the protection framework for holders of crypto assets and other clients of service providers [47].

### MiCA & NFTs
A relevant point of this regulation is that non-fungible tokens (NFT) that are individual and different would be excluded from the scope of application of the MiCA. **This unless the issuer creates a "collection" of assets for purchase.** In addition, MiCA will force the issuing entity of the NFT under its regulatory framework [47].

### MiCA Objectives
MiCA aims to regulate any digital representation of value or rights that can be shared or stored electronically, using distributed ledger technology (DLT), blockchain or similar.
The Law can be broken down into four general objectives, which are [47]:

- [x] **Provide legal certainty for** crypto assets that are not covered by current EU financial services legislation.
- [x] **Replace existing national frameworks applicable to** crypto assets not covered by current EU financial services legislation. This seeks to create a common regulatory framework for this type of services in the EU.
- [x] Establish uniform rules **for crypto asset service providers and issuers** at the EU level.
- [x] Establish specific rules **for stablecoins**, even when they are traded as electronic money.
