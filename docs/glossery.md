## Segment

### Applications

- [x] Deployment
- [x] Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV)

#### Deployment

##### Bio-geoengineering

Interventions that seek to deliberately manipulate natural biological processes for increased carbon sequestration, biodiversity preservation, ecosystem service provision, and the continued sustainable use of natural resources.

##### Natural Capital Management

Interventions that enable the sustainable utilization of natural capital (such as land, water, air, minerals, forests, fisheries, and wild flora and fauna) for continued ecosystem service provision to support human life and economic processes. Natural capital management includes both managed and natural ecosystems.

##### Sustainable Ag Productivity

Interventions that help producers boost crop yield and livestock productivity while minimizing the environmental impact of agriculture.

#### MRV

###### Biodiversity Baselining & Monitoring
The assessment of species richness in a given area through surveying, monitoring, and verification. This can include flora, fauna, and/or funga.

###### Forest Carbon Measurement & Verification
The process of assessing and validating the amount of carbon stored in the woody and non-woody biomass of trees as well as the rate new carbon is being sequestered into biomass from vegetation growth. Forest carbon measurement and validation is applicable to plantation forestry, natural forests (tropical, temperate & boreal), agroforestry systems and mangroves.

###### GHG Measurement
The assessment of the levels of greenhouse gas emissions with the unit of measure as tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e).

###### Mapping & Monitoring of Land & Ocean Systems
The process of understanding the topography of a given area in terrestrial and marine ecosystems, their current conditions, and how they are changing over time.

###### Soil Carbon Measurement & Verification
The process of assessing and validating the amount of carbon stored in global soils either as organic (SOC) or inorganic (SIC) matter. The majority of applications have focused on SOC as a climate mitigation strategy however, there is increasing awareness that SIC losses are more significant than previously thought.
Soil carbon measurement and validation can be used on Agricultural land, Grassland & Savannah-type habitats.


## Segment

### Applications

- [x] Connection
- [x] Transparency

##### Transparency

###### Environmental Market Attribution

The ability to identify, track, and trace the provenance and transactions of credits or payments derived from Nature. Includes voluntary carbon markets (VCMs), payments for ecosystem services (PES), and biodiversity credits.

###### Land Titling and Tenure

Interventions related to land administration that make possible the determination, recording, and disseminating of information about ownership, value, and use of land and its associated resources.

###### Supply Chain Traceability

The ability to identify, track, and trace the provenance and journey of products and their inputs as they move along the supply chain from source to consumer

##### Connection

###### Capacity Building & Community Engagement

Any intervention that develops and strengthens an individual’s, community’s, and/or organization’s skills and ability to adopt sustainable practices. Ideally, these interventions also support decision-making that enables economic empowerment while mitigating anthropogenic impacts on biodiversity and climate change/environment.
