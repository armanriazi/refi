## VCM [11]

`SBTi` Science Based Target Initiative - An initiative that mobilizes companies to set emission reduction targets based on climate science. A collaboration between CDP, the UN Global Compact, the WRI, and WWF, the SBTi defines and promotes best practice in science-based target setting, offers resources and guidance to reduce barriers to adoption, and independently assesses and approves companies’ targets. Adopting an SBTi-approved target is one of the We Mean Business Coalition commitments 

`BVCM` Beyond Value Chain Mitigation () - Mitigation action or investment that takes place outside of an organization’s value chain. This includes activities that avoid or reduce GHG emissions, and those that remove and store GHGs from the atmosphere. The purchase of high-quality carbon credits beyond a company’s value chain is an example of BVCM

`VCMI` Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative () - An international initiative to drive credible, net zero-aligned participation in voluntary carbon markets. VCMI was established to help ensure that voluntary carbon markets make a significant, measurable, and positive contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement goals, while also promoting inclusive and sustainable development.

`ICVCM`Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market () - An independent governance body that is developing and enforcing a set of Core Carbon Principles (CCPs) that establishes a new threshold standard for high-quality carbon credits in the voluntary carbon market. The ICVCM will oversee a process to determine the Eligibility of carbon-crediting programs as well as which carbon credit Categories will become CCP-Approved.

`CORSIA` Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation () - CORSIA is a global scheme to manage emissions from the international aviation industry. CORSIA compliments other carbon reduction measures by offsetting the amount of CO2 emissions that cannot be reduced through the use of technological improvements, operational improvements, and sustainable aviation fuels with emissions units from the carbon market. Specific eligibility criteria exists and is determined by the International Civil Aviation Organization. 

`Climate Contribution Approach` An approach where a company purchases or invests in carbon credits or other form of beyond value chain mitigation (BVCM). In a contribution approach, retired carbon credits are not counted towards, nor represent compensation for, a company’s remaining value chain emissions. The retirement of these carbon credits represents a contribution to overall global efforts to mitigate climate change. Both money-fortonne and tonne-for-tonne approaches can both be contribution approaches if companies are using contribution claims. 

`Tonne-for-tonne` A method for determining the nature and scale of a company`s commitment to beyond value chain. In addition to delivering on its science-based target (covering value chain emissions), a company would deliver mitigation beyond its value chain proportional to the climate impact of some percentage of the greenhouse gases emitted by that company in a defined period (e.g. in a given year or since the inception of the company). The volume of finance deployed towards BVCM would be determined by the price that a company pays per tCO2e of BVCM (in the case of carbon credits, this would be determined by market prices) and the percentage of unabated emissions that are being “matched" with BVCM in that defined period

`Money-for-tonne` A method for determining the nature and scale of a company's commitment to beyond value chain. In addition to delivering on its science-based targets (covering value chain mitigation), a company would channel finance into BVCM based on predefined price of unabated greenhouse gas emitted by that company in a defined period (e.g. in a given year or since the inception of the company). The volume of finance deployed towards BVCM would be determined by the chosen cost of carbon (e.g. a cost of carbon or otherwise) and the unabated emissions in that defined period

`Money-for-money` A method for determining the nature and scale of a company's commitment to beyond value chain. In addition to delivering on its science-based target (covering value chain emissions), a company would allocate a share of revenues or profit towards financing climate mitigation beyond the value chain. The volume of finance deployed towards BVCM would be determined by the chosen denominator (e.g. profit or revenue) and the chosen percentage

### Applications

- [x] Deployment
- [x] Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV)

#### Deployment

##### Bio-geoengineering

Interventions that seek to deliberately manipulate natural biological processes for increased carbon sequestration, biodiversity preservation, ecosystem service provision, and the continued sustainable use of natural resources.

##### Natural Capital Management

Interventions that enable the sustainable utilization of natural capital (such as land, water, air, minerals, forests, fisheries, and wild flora and fauna) for continued ecosystem service provision to support human life and economic processes. Natural capital management includes both managed and natural ecosystems.

##### Sustainable Ag Productivity

Interventions that help producers boost crop yield and livestock productivity while minimizing the environmental impact of agriculture.

#### MRV

###### Biodiversity Baselining & Monitoring
The assessment of species richness in a given area through surveying, monitoring, and verification. This can include flora, fauna, and/or funga.

###### Forest Carbon Measurement & Verification
The process of assessing and validating the amount of carbon stored in the woody and non-woody biomass of trees as well as the rate new carbon is being sequestered into biomass from vegetation growth. Forest carbon measurement and validation is applicable to plantation forestry, natural forests (tropical, temperate & boreal), agroforestry systems and mangroves.

###### GHG Measurement
The assessment of the levels of greenhouse gas emissions with the unit of measure as tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e).

###### Mapping & Monitoring of Land & Ocean Systems
The process of understanding the topography of a given area in terrestrial and marine ecosystems, their current conditions, and how they are changing over time.

###### Soil Carbon Measurement & Verification
The process of assessing and validating the amount of carbon stored in global soils either as organic (SOC) or inorganic (SIC) matter. The majority of applications have focused on SOC as a climate mitigation strategy however, there is increasing awareness that SIC losses are more significant than previously thought.
Soil carbon measurement and validation can be used on Agricultural land, Grassland & Savannah-type habitats.

### Applications

- [x] Connection
- [x] Transparency

##### Transparency

###### Environmental Market Attribution

The ability to identify, track, and trace the provenance and transactions of credits or payments derived from Nature. Includes voluntary carbon markets (VCMs), payments for ecosystem services (PES), and biodiversity credits.

###### Land Titling and Tenure

Interventions related to land administration that make possible the determination, recording, and disseminating of information about ownership, value, and use of land and its associated resources.

###### Supply Chain Traceability

The ability to identify, track, and trace the provenance and journey of products and their inputs as they move along the supply chain from source to consumer

##### Connection

###### Capacity Building & Community Engagement

Any intervention that develops and strengthens an individual’s, community’s, and/or organization’s skills and ability to adopt sustainable practices. Ideally, these interventions also support decision-making that enables economic empowerment while mitigating anthropogenic impacts on biodiversity and climate change/environment.
