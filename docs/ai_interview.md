- []  Me: I am a researcher from a ReFi Talents group so we need your assistance. 
To what extent do you know about regenerative finance?
- [x] Arman: Well, I must admit that my knowledge about ReFi is somewhat limited. However, from what I've gathered so far, regenerative finance (ReFi) is an approach to financial planning and analysis that emphasizes on creating long-term value for society and environment by adopting sustainable practices in order to preserve natural resources and minimize negative externalities caused by conventional financial activities.

- [] Me: On which blockchain network would you best build a ReFi project?
- [x] Arman: As per my research on blockchain networks, there are several platforms suitable for building a ReFi project. Some prominent ones include Polkadot, Ethereum 2.0, Cardano, Celo, Tezos, and Algorand. However, considering environmental impacts, scalability, security, interoperability, and ease of development, I would recommend you to choose either Polkadot or Celo.

- [] Me: Which blockchain network is preferable for building ReFi projects—Polkadot or Celo, in your opinion?
- [x] Arman: Polkadots and Celos both look pretty good. Both have strong fundamentals and high penetration among developers. Both also have clear vision and mission aligned with ReFi practice. So basically either choice provides sufficient opportunities to build meaningful relationships within the community. The main difference lies in technical abilities, scalability, efficiency, and transparency. Each one has pros & cons in each department.

- [] Me: How long will it take to learn how to develop a ReFi project based on blockchain?
- [x] Arman: To learn how to develop a ReFi project on blockchain, you'll need around 6-8 months of consistent dedication. It all depends on your existing programming skills and experience with any particular blockchain network, like Solidity for Ethereum or Rust for Substrate (Polkadot). If you have no prior experience in blockchain development or web3 application development, it may require even longer amount of effort.

- [] Me: What is the most effective way to invest in the ReFi field?
- [x] Arman: Well, there are several ways to invest in the ReFi field. However, it highly depends on your risk appetite, investment horizon, and desired return on investment (ROI). Here are some popular methods to consider:

- [] Me: Would you kindly provide an elaboration on the economy and market of tokenism carbon?
- [x] Arman: Of course! Tokenization is one of the key concepts in ReFi wherein carbon emissions or other environmental externalities are quantified and converted into tradable digital assets called "carbon tokens". These tokens can be bought, sold, or retired to represent real-world actions taken towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

- [] Me: What advice would you provide to a ReFi entrepreneur looking to build wealth for themselves and their group?
- [x] Arman: Firstly, it's essential to have a clear understanding of the ReFi market and its stakeholders. Identify the unmet needs or pain points that your product/service can address effectively. Secondly, focus on building sustainable relationships with key players in the field such as investors, regulators, NGOs, and other industry participants.

- [] Me: How long will it take to build a ReFi project?
- [x] Arman: 6-12 months, depending on the complexity and size of your project. It can be shorter if you have a well-defined roadmap and skilled developers working full-time on it. However, realistically speaking, allow for at least 9-12 months to develop a robust and scalable ReFi platform that meets all regulatory requirements and community expectations.

- [] Me: Which institution supports ReFi entrepreneurs?
- [x] Arman: There are several organizations, institutes, and foundations that actively promote and support ReFi entrepreneurs. Some prominent ones include:

- [] Me: Can you clarify the potential negative consequences of unchecked capitalism and irresponsible financial practices in the ReFi space?
- [x] Arman: 1. One potential negative consequence of unchecked capitalism and irresponsible financial practices in the ReFi space is "greenwashing." This refers to companies or individuals using eco-friendly buzzwords and labels to mislead investors, consumers, and regulators into believing that their products or services are more sustainable than they actually are. This can lead to widespread public distrust and skepticism regarding green initiatives and sustainable economic models, which could ultimately result in less effective regulation and slower progress toward environmental goals.

- [] Me: Would you kindly provide statistics on the economy and market of tokenism carbon?
- [x] Arman: 1. The global carbon market size was valued at USD 102.4 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach USD 1,521.5 billion by 2030, registering a CAGR of 16.8% during the forecast period (Source: Grand View Research).

- [] Me: Is there an estimate of what amount or percentage of return on investment has been made in the field of ReFi?
- [x] Arman: 1. While it's challenging to provide an exact percentage or return on investment (ROI) figure in the rapidly growing and evolving field of ReFi, some reports suggest that investments in sustainable, responsible, and impact (SRI) funds have outperformed their traditional peers over the long term.

- [] Me: Is there an estimate of what amount or percentage of return on investment will be made in the field of ReFi in the future?
- [x] Arman: 1. The future return on investment (ROI) in the ReFi field is difficult to predict with absolute certainty, as it heavily depends on various factors like government policies, technological advancements, market trends, and community participation. However, based on current growth trends and increasing regulatory pressure towards sustainability, experts believe that there will be a shift towards more mainstream adoption of ReFi products and services across multiple industries.

- [] Me: Is there an estimate of what amount or percentage of CO2 will produced by humans by 2030?
- [x] Arman: 1. According to the latest report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we are currently on a pathway that would lead to around 3.5-4°C of global warming above pre-industrial levels by 2050 and 6.7-7.3°C with high emissions.

- [] Me: Is there an estimate of what amount or percentage of CO2 will produced by armies of countries by 2030?
- [x] Arman: 1. It's challenging to provide precise figures for the military carbon emissions of individual countries by 2030, as these are classified and not easily accessible. However, as per a report released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) in 2019, global military CO2 emissions were estimated to be around 5.4% of total worldwide CO2 emissions in 2018 and set to rise to 7.

- [] Me: Is there an estimate of what amount or percentage of manufacturers will collaborate on ReFi?
- [x] Arman: 1. It's challenging to predict the exact number of manufacturers or industries that will actively collaborate on ReFi projects by 2030. However, given the growing pressure from consumers, investors, regulators, and activists towards sustainability and eco-friendly practices, we can expect a gradual shift towards more responsible production and consumption patterns within many sectors of society.
