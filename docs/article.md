# Regenerative Finance
Regenerative finance (ReFi) also overlaps with the decentralized science (DeSci) movement, ReFi is a set of tools and ideas built on top of blockchains, that aim to create economies which are regenerative, rather than extractive or exploitative. Eventually, extractive systems deplete the resources available and collapse; without regenerative mechanisms, they lack resilience [^1].

ReFi operates on the assumption that the creation of monetary value must be decoupled from the unsustainable extraction of resources from our planet and communities.  regenerative activities like planting trees, removing plastic from the ocean, or restoring a degraded ecosystem. Facilitate large-scale collaboration on global issues such as climate change and biodiversity loss [^1].

 ReFi has the potential to reshape the global economy and make tangible impacts on the lives of people and societies. ReFi has the potential to provide solutions for global poverty, healthcare, education, and a myriad of social issues.The capabilities of purpose-driven missions, such as impact investing, are elevated through ReFi’s technology [^33].

the focus of regenerative finance is on initiatives that have the potential to go beyond addressing existing problems and actively work to restore and rebuild natural systems and build resilience for the future [^34].

“ReFi stands for Regenerative Finance and refers to a large-scale financial system that operates in a non-extractive way. A portion of the value generated and transferred flows back to the planet, and climate-positive actions become financially rewarding.” - Toucan protocol [^35]

“ReFi stands for Regenerative Finance, and it broadly relates to a movement aiming to use finance as a way to support regenerative and restorative outcomes in social, environmental, and economic systems.” - ReFiDAO [^36]

## Eight Principles of a regenerative economy

1.  Edge effect abundance
2.  Seeks balance
3.  Empowered participation
4.  Views wealth holistically
5.  Innovative adaptive responsive
6.  Robust circulation
7.  Honors place & community
8.  In right relationship

## Sustainability vs Regenerative

Regenerative is seeking strategies for less harmful social and environmental practices (“do less bad”) to achieve competitive advantage rather than “doing more good.”. Sustainable companies aim to maintain the current state of natural systems in the present: they focus on reducing negative impact, preventing further degradation, and conserving resources [^13]

# Regenerative economic

Regenerative economics can be viewed as applying the natural laws and patterns of systemic health, self-organization, self-renewal, and regenerative vitality to socioeconomic systems [^12].

 It can also help identify feedback loops, leverage points, and unintended consequences of specific actions or interventions [^13].

Analytic to Holistic (Systemic). Where most modern theories imagine economies are built of independent agents following rational self-interest; Here, instead of the traditional emphasis on how much money is exchanged (GDP), regenerative practitioners focus on where money goes and whether its impacts are constructive or destructive, short-term or lasting [^14].

ReFi enables programming of incentives that lead to changed behaviour for the better of the planet – and empowers local communities to monetize stewardship of their natural capital and ecological assets – something we know is critical to ecosystem restoration and biodiversity protection [^2].

# ESG
Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into capital allocation and portfolio management processes, using IFC’s own investment practices as a model. IFC is playing its part to support the growth of the market by funding the development of enhanced stock market indices, financial instruments, and through targeted market research. Leading analysts have developed the necessary techniques to integrate ESG issues into financial analysis [^12].

# Digital transformation and Blockchain

Global climate infrastructure, tools and coordination technologies are needed to keep pace with the changing planetary ecosystem, transcend borders and span social, economic, cultural and governmental domains. This is where blockchain can help [2].
Blockchain is one of several emerging technologies being explored to address urgent environmental issues such as biodiversity loss, disaster displacement and energy grid deficiencies, as well as resource allocation and coordination –all critical parts of this complex, intersectional, intergenerational and multicultural climate challenge. The defining qualities of blockchains – decentralized, open and global – make them powerful tools that can provide breadth and depth to current climate mitigation and adaptation efforts [2].

Blockchain can democratize ownership and reallocate resources to shift power dynamics to the people most knowledgeable of, and most vulnerable to, the effects of climate change. Blockchain could also improve the transparency and integrity of existing decarbonization mechanisms like carbon markets. When paired with digital tools for measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) – such as remote sensors, drone imagery and AI – digital environmental assets and carbon accounting systems can provide real-time visibility into the effectiveness of emissions reduction and sequestration efforts [2].


# dMRV

<figure markdown>

<figcaption>DMRV Platform [^29].</figcaption>
</figure>

Key characteristics of DMRV that distinguish it from manual MRV include [^31]:

- [x] Digitally native platforms that can receive data from a range of sensors and data sources, including manual inputs, and automatically analyze and process data using algorithms and advanced models [^31].
- [x] Checkpoints and checklists within the platforms that ensure consistency and accuracy [^31].
- [x] A platform that can be periodically certified for use within specified project parameters this allows some project validation and verification procedures to be automated to streamline project development while ensuring integrity [^31].

## Credit Issuance 

Credit issuance is ultimately a process of (MRV) monitoring, reporting, and verification: monitoring to calculate a project’s emissions reductions (i.e., credits), reporting to document the calculations before a credit registry, and verification of the calculations by independent auditors.[^29].

DMRV platforms would modernize credit issuance in at least 4 critical ways [^29].

1.  Shift from manual data collection to satellite observation [^29].
2.  Shift from inconsistent, manual calculation to uniform, automated calculation [^29].
3.  Shift from auditing projects to certifying platforms [^29].
4.  Shift from static documents to interactive, digital visualization [^29].

## Carbon Credit

Credit registries, such as Verra, now refer to future digital crediting platforms as digital MRV (DMRV) platforms. Since our founding in 2018, Pachama has sought to lead the way in DMRV and become the first registry-certified DMRV platform. Carbon credit to calculate each term in this equation, a DMRV must produce three core outputs [29]: 

- [x] an estimate of baseline emissions [^29].
- [x] a map of forest carbon [^29].
- [x] a map of forest cover change (deforestation and/or reforestation) to know where carbon has been lost or gained [^29].

## DMRV for Renewables

CCD has developed ML-based models to estimate canopy height and above-ground biomass (AGB) over woodlands at sub-national scale. This allows for identification of forest deforestation and disturbance, and aids efforts to conserve biodiversity hotspots. CCD offers forecasting and scheduling services for independent power producers [^32].

### Data sources

SCADA systems or other third party sources; India’s Central Transmission Utility (CTU); daily generation reports (DGRs) [^32].

### Data collection

SCADA data is compared with other sources to understand the issuance of carbon credits. Real-time data is also shared daily with the Global Carbon Council (GCC), for both energy and carbon credits [^32].

### Data auditing

SCADA data is audited against other sources to identify discrepancies with meter data. This audit provides an optimised estimation of the issued carbon credits through SCADA data [^32].

Having an independent source of data (such as SCADA) to verify the amount of carbon credits being claimed by projects on a registry can significantly reduce the costs associated with verification. Another major benefit is that this can accelerate the issuance of carbon credits, allowing new issuances on a bi-annual or monthly basis rather than once a year [^32].

### Automated SDG extraction from project documents

Identifying which SDGs a project contributes to is a crucial task, and one that can be very time consuming for companies or project developers who rely solely on manual methods. However, AI can be used to intelligently extract Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) relevant to a particular project based on the unstructured content contained in related documents (e.g. images and text). This method relies on Natural Language Processing (NLP) [^32].

CCD has conducted R&D and testing on more than 50 documents in order to develop its own NLP service. Currently, the company’s models operate with 85% accuracy, which is projected to reach 95% within the next two quarters [^32]:

# NCS
Natural climate solutions are ways to sequester carbon through conservation, restoration, and improved land management of the world’s forests, grasslands, and wetlands. Three types of NCS funds are emerging with different sources for returns and target investors (see Figure below).

- [x] Sustainable product funds: focus on greening supply chains for those with net-zero and sustainable sourcing commitments.
- [x] Nature+ funds: invest directly in NCS to provide financial and nonfinancial returns for long-term investors.
- [x] Carbon pure play funds: secure carbon credits from NCS investments within a broader carbon sequestration portfolio.

# Offsetting

Carbon offset processes are currently dominated by private actors providing legitimacy for the market. The two largest of these, Verra and Gold Standard, provide auditing services, carbon registries and a marketplace to sell carbon offsets, making them ubiquitous in the whole process [43].

Biodiversity offsetting refers to actions, such as restoring degraded land, that are intended to compensate for biodiversity destruction taking place at a different time and place [^24].
An offset market is created when a law requires companies to offset their negative impact on bi-odiversity, through actions such as restoration projects. These actions grant the right to tradable permits to destroy biodiversity elsewhere. If a company has destroyed more biodiversity than it has permits for, it can either perform “offsetting actions” or buy permits from another company. Correspondingly, a company that owns more permits than it has destroyed can choose to sell its excess permits to another company. The legislation that creates the market determines the rules surrounding the permits [^24].

Creating a biodiversity offset market requires three things [^24]:

- [x] New legislation introducing mandatory restoration targets, in order to create the demand.
- [x] A policy framework that considers that restoration compensates for destruction taking place elsewhere and at a different time;
- [x] A market framework allowing for the free trading of offset permits.

Let’s take the example of a company wanting to build an airport in the South of Spain in an area that is a habitat for flamingos. With biodiversity offsetting, the law would allow the construction of the airport, provided that the company tries to avoid or minimize the impact on biodiversity. Any residual impact must be offset by recreating a habitat for flamingos within a radius of X kilometres [^24].



## Put a Price on Nature

There are two main methods [^24]:

1.  Revealed preference methods: Prices are inferred from the prices of goods and services traded in markets. For example, let’s imagine two identical flats where only the second one has a view over Central Park. The first one sold for $1 million, whereas the second one sold for $1,5 million.This method will consider that the price difference represents the value of a view over Central Park and a meaningful factor in determining the value of Central Park [^24].

2.  Stated preference methods: these methods are mostly based on surveys. People are being asked how much they are willing to pay for a natural site not to be destroyed, or inversely how much they want to receive in exchange for its destruction. As an example, a 1980 survey asked residents of Chicago how much they would be willing to pay to preserve the visibility over the Grand Canyon. The average price was $90. A similar survey was conducted a year and a half later, and the average answer came this time at $169 [^24].


# Towards Generating Value Carbon Reduction for Carbon Offset Footprint to Produce Carbon Credit

## Blockchain

In the recent years, tokenization of (physical) assets and the creation of a digital version that is stored on the blockchain gained more interest. By utilizing blockchain technology, asset ownership can be tokenized, which enables fractional ownership, reduces intermediaries, and provides a secure and transparent ledger. This not only increases liquidity but also expands access to previously illiquid assets (like carbon offsets). The blockchain ledger allows for real-time settlement of transactions, increasing efficiency and reducing the risk of fraud. Additionally, tokens can be programmed to include certain rules and restrictions, such as limiting the number of tokens that can be issued or specifying how they can be traded, which can provide greater transparency and control over the asset [^43].

### Re-fungibility

Re-fungibility is an important step towards building real life models of ownership rights. Often a unique item may be owned by multiple entities in different proportions. The examples of such shared ownership are abundant: Timeshares, co-ownership of art, fractional car ownership, etc. For that purpose, Unique Network provides the special mode of Collection: Re-Fungible. The Re-fungible token can be minted and then partially transferred to multiple owners [17].

### Fungible collection mode
Fungible collection mode is targeted at the same set of use cases as ERC-20 tokens. Any non-unique and divisible resource can be represented as a Fungible token. While these use cases are not the prime focus of Unique Network, many applications need this functionality in parallel to the NFT the examples include: non-unique game resources, rating points in applications with social networking capabilities, voting tokens, etc [17].

## Carbon offset solution

The solar panels provide information regarding their electricity generation, from which a figure is derived that represents the amount of carbon avoided and fed into a smart contract. A smart contract is a self-executing application that exist on the blockchain and performs actions based on its underlying code. In the blockchain-based carbon offset process, smart contracts convert the different tokens and send them to the owner’s wallet. The tokens used within the process are compliant with the ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token (NFT) standard, which represents a unique token that is distinguishable from others and cannot be exchanged for other units of the same asset. A practical example is a work of art that, even if replicated, is always slightly different [^43].

In the first stage of the process, the owner claims a carbon receipt, based on the amount of carbon avoided by the solar panel. Thereby the aggregated amount of carbon avoided (also stored in a database just for replication purposes) is sent to the smart contract, which issues a carbon receipt of the corresponding figure to the owner. Carbon receipts can further be exchanged for a uniform amount of carbon credits (e.g. 5 kg, 10 kg, 15 kg) by interacting with the second smart contract. Carbon credits are designed to be traded on the decentralised marketplace, where the price is determined by the supply and demand of its participants. Ultimately, carbon credits can be exchanged for carbon certificates indicating the certificate owner and the amount of carbon offset. Comparable with a university diploma, carbon certificates are tied to the address of the owner that initiated the exchange and are therefore non-tradable. Figure 1 illustrates the process of the described blockchain-based carbon offset solution [^43]:

### Tokenization
Tokenized carbon assets can be traded on a secondary market, ensuring a price mechanism for CO2. That enables for example asset managers and companies to incorporate carbon offsets directly into their offerings [^4].

Tokenization can aid the voluntary carbon market in a range of ways, including by increasing liquidity and accessibility. Buyers and sellers can more easily trade credits, which can help to increase demand for credits and reduce volatility in the market. Tokenization can also help to reduce transaction costs and provide faster settlement times. The use of blockchain technology also increases transparency and tracking: it allows for the creation of a permanent, immutable record of all transactions, thereby enhancing the VCM’s credibility, as it provides a clear record of the history of each carbon credit. It can also help to reduce the risk of fraud and ensure that carbon credits are properly accounted for [^11].

### Carbon Credit

A carbon credit is a unit of exchange that businesses, organizations and individuals can use to offset their greenhouse gas emissions. One carbon credit is equivalent to one metric ton of greenhouse gases removed from the atmosphere. A carbon credit and a carbon offset are synonymous terminology [60].

#### Who’s buying carbon credits?

There are two flavors of carbon markets, the large worldwide compliance market and the smaller voluntary market [60].

#### How carbon credits are generated?

Everyone who is taking actions that remove or avoid emissions — for example conserving a forest — can apply to get carbon credits issued. For this, they’ll need to go to a standards body like Verra or Gold Standard. They then need to develop a detailed project design document (PDD) with estimates of carbon avoidance/reduction over time, and a solid business plan. The carbon standard screens the PDD, and an approved third-party auditor checks it as well — this party is called the validation and verification body (VVB). If the PDD meets the standard’s requirements, the project is validated for a certain number of carbon credits. Project development is, by then, in full swing. Once the actual emissions reduction/avoidance has occurred, a batch of carbon credits — each with its own serial number — is issued, with regular checks (so called performance verifications) conducted by the VVBs [^46].

One carbon credit is a unique, independently verified reduction of greenhouse gases (GHGs) traceable back to the carbon project that generated the emission reduction. Project types include forestry and other land use projects, emission reductions in industrial processes; carbon projects are [60]:

- [x] Real – the project’s carbon reduction is measurable [60].
- [x] Additional – the value of reductions must be beyond “business as usual.”  [60].
- [x] Verified – An independent and qualified third party has conducted a detailed reviewed of all aspects of the carbon project, and attests to the emission reduction claim [60].
- [x] Registered – Carbon credits are unique, serialized, tracked and can be retired only once [60].
- [x] Permanent – The GHG removal, represented by carbon credits, is permanent and cannot be reversed. For forest projects, the project registrar provides a robust buffer system to account for any unforeseen reversals (forest fire, etc.) [60].

The project owner can now sell their credits to a carbon broker, or they can bridge them on-chain and sell them directly to interested end-users, pool them and use them in the ever-growing ecosystem of decentralized finance [^46].

`Averages`
:    Time elapsed before the developer can secure funding: 1-2 years [^46].
:    Time from project inception to credit issuance: 3-5 years [^46].
:    Cost to get the first project certification: $50-100k [^46].

#### How can carbon credit tokenization help the VCM [^46]?

- [x] Efficiency & Disintermediation
- [x] Healthier and more open markets
- [x] Liquid marketplaces
- [x] Price discovery
- [x] Eliminate double counting
- [x] New sources of demand
- [x] Better financing for developers
- [x] Fractionalization

### Benefits of Tokenized Carbon Credits

<figure markdown>
![Benefits of Tokenized Carbon Credits](https://armanriazi.github.io/refi/assets/attachments/sulolab.jpg){ width=600 height=400 align=center }
<figcaption>Benefits of Tokenized Carbon Credits [^44].</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Increased Accessibility

Carbon markets become more accessible as tokenization removes geographical restrictions. Anyone across the world can purchase, trade, and retire tokenized carbon credits through digital platforms [^44].

#### Fractional Ownership

Each credit can be split into smaller tokenized units, allowing individuals with limited budgets to offset their footprint [^44].

Tokenized carbon credits can be ‘fractionalized’ into units that are *smaller than 1 metric tonne* — like a currency. This benefits small-scale carbon projects, who could issue credits on smaller plots of land with significantly lower costs. For example, carbon credit development on a 5ha forest nets around like 30-50 tonnes of carbon credits per year, but measurements would cost around 50k USD. On the other hand, purchasing, selling and retiring carbon credits becomes more accessible. The retail and transportation industries also have a growing need for **sub-tonne carbon credits**, for example to offset exactly the right amount of carbon for the production of a single t-shirt or flight [^46].

#### Enhanced Liquidity

Tokens can be seamlessly traded on decentralized exchanges, eliminating intermediaries and reducing costs [^44].

#### Transparency

The blockchain provides an immutable record of a credit’s origins and ownership history, preventing double-counting or other fraud [^44].

#### Automation

Smart contracts automate credit issuance, payments, transfers, and retirement, streamlining the process [^44].

#### Price Discovery

Tokenization provides transparent pricing data, increasing market efficiency and competition [^44].


### How do I know that a carbon credit is real? 

`What are the standards used to verify carbon credits?`
:   Carbon projects are governed by the GHG Registries.

- [x] Climate Action Reserve (CAR) –  A carbon offset registry for the U.S., Mexico and Canada.
- [x] VERRA – Verra registers carbon projects under a several different standards. The recognizable Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) is the largest carbon project registry for the worldwide voluntary carbon market. Other Verra standards ensure that carbon projects are also meeting human and ecological needs, such as the Climate Community and Biodiversity standard and the Sustainable Development Verified Impact Standard (SD VISta) ensures that the carbon projects are also meeting both human and ecological needs.
- [x] American Carbon Registry (ACR) – A carbon offset registry for the voluntary and California regulatory carbon markets.
- [x] Gold Standard Foundation (GSF) – A certification standard for offset projects located mostly in developing countries. Gold Standard projects have a high level of achievement of Sustainable Development Goals.
- [x] UN Clean Development Mechanism – The UN CDM is an international registry used by compliance markets around the world.

# Standards

## CCB
 The Community and Biodiversity Standards Standards were developed by the CCBA and have been managed by the Verra since November 2014. The CCB Standards foster the integration of best-practice and multiple-benefit approaches into project design and implementation [58].

### Vera CCB
The Verra Registry is the central repository for all information and documentation related to CCB projects. The registry facilitates public comment periods, and records the generation, retirement, and cancellation of all Verified Carbon Units that bear a CCB label, which indicates that an emission reduction unit was generated during a CCB-verified period [59].

### American CCB

American Carbon Registry(ACR) Founded as a nonprofit entity in 1996 by Winrock International, American Carbon Registry (ACR) is the first voluntary offset program and **focuses on the voluntary market** and the **California Cap-and-Trade program** in the U.S. CCB Projects are predominantly specific to land use. An independent third-party verifies the social benefits that accompany a CCB certified carbon project [60].

## GSF

Gold Standard Foundation established by the World Wildlife Fund in 2003 and based in Geneva, Switzerland, the Gold Standard Foundation administers a secure and transparent transaction between climate funders, climate security, and sustainable development [60].

## CAR

The Climate Action Reserve is the premier North American GHG registry. Its published protocols are used by the California Cap-and-Trade program [60].

# CDM
The Clean Development Mechanism, allows a country with an emission-reduction or emission-limitation commitment under the Kyoto Protocol (Annex B Party) to implement an emission-reduction project in developing countries. Such projects can earn saleable certified emission reduction (CER) credits, each equivalent to one tonne of CO2, which can be counted towards meeting Kyoto targets [61].

# Protocols
## Kyoto

While the Kyoto Protocol provided a framework for reducing the greenhouse gas emissions of industrialized nations, current climate change negotiations envisage future commitments for major co2 emitters among developing countries. This document uses an updated version of the gtap-e general equilibrium model to analyse the economic implications of reducing carbon emissions under different carbon trading scenarios [^20].
