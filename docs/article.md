# Regenerative Finance
Regenerative finance (ReFi) also overlaps with the decentralized science (DeSci) movement, ReFi is a set of tools and ideas built on top of blockchains, that aim to create economies which are regenerative, rather than extractive or exploitative. Eventually, extractive systems deplete the resources available and collapse; without regenerative mechanisms, they lack resilience [^1].

ReFi operates on the assumption that the creation of monetary value must be decoupled from the unsustainable extraction of resources from our planet and communities.  regenerative activities like planting trees, removing plastic from the ocean, or restoring a degraded ecosystem. Facilitate large-scale collaboration on global issues such as climate change and biodiversity loss [^1].

 ReFi has the potential to reshape the global economy and make tangible impacts on the lives of people and societies. ReFi has the potential to provide solutions for global poverty, healthcare, education, and a myriad of social issues.The capabilities of purpose-driven missions, such as impact investing, are elevated through ReFi’s technology [^33].

the focus of regenerative finance is on initiatives that have the potential to go beyond addressing existing problems and actively work to restore and rebuild natural systems and build resilience for the future [^34].

“ReFi stands for Regenerative Finance and refers to a large-scale financial system that operates in a non-extractive way. A portion of the value generated and transferred flows back to the planet, and climate-positive actions become financially rewarding.” - Toucan protocol [^35]

“ReFi stands for Regenerative Finance, and it broadly relates to a movement aiming to use finance as a way to support regenerative and restorative outcomes in social, environmental, and economic systems.” - ReFiDAO [^36]

## Eight Principles of a regenerative economy

1.  Edge effect abundance
2.  Seeks balance
3.  Empowered participation
4.  Views wealth holistically
5.  Innovative adaptive responsive
6.  Robust circulation
7.  Honors place & community
8.  In right relationship

## Sustainability vs Regenerative

Regenerative is seeking strategies for less harmful social and environmental practices (“do less bad”) to achieve competitive advantage rather than “doing more good.”. Sustainable companies aim to maintain the current state of natural systems in the present: they focus on reducing negative impact, preventing further degradation, and conserving resources [^13]

# Regenerative economic

Regenerative economics can be viewed as applying the natural laws and patterns of systemic health, self-organization, self-renewal, and regenerative vitality to socioeconomic systems [^12].

 It can also help identify feedback loops, leverage points, and unintended consequences of specific actions or interventions [^13].

Analytic to Holistic (Systemic). Where most modern theories imagine economies are built of independent agents following rational self-interest; Here, instead of the traditional emphasis on how much money is exchanged (GDP), regenerative practitioners focus on where money goes and whether its impacts are constructive or destructive, short-term or lasting [^14].

ReFi enables programming of incentives that lead to changed behaviour for the better of the planet – and empowers local communities to monetize stewardship of their natural capital and ecological assets – something we know is critical to ecosystem restoration and biodiversity protection [^2].

# ESG
Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into capital allocation and portfolio management processes, using IFC’s own investment practices as a model. IFC is playing its part to support the growth of the market by funding the development of enhanced stock market indices, financial instruments, and through targeted market research. Leading analysts have developed the necessary techniques to integrate ESG issues into financial analysis [^12].

# Digital transformation and Blockchain

Global climate infrastructure, tools and coordination technologies are needed to keep pace with the changing planetary ecosystem, transcend borders and span social, economic, cultural and governmental domains. This is where blockchain can help [2].
Blockchain is one of several emerging technologies being explored to address urgent environmental issues such as biodiversity loss, disaster displacement and energy grid deficiencies, as well as resource allocation and coordination –all critical parts of this complex, intersectional, intergenerational and multicultural climate challenge. The defining qualities of blockchains – decentralized, open and global – make them powerful tools that can provide breadth and depth to current climate mitigation and adaptation efforts [2].

Blockchain can democratize ownership and reallocate resources to shift power dynamics to the people most knowledgeable of, and most vulnerable to, the effects of climate change. Blockchain could also improve the transparency and integrity of existing decarbonization mechanisms like carbon markets. When paired with digital tools for measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) – such as remote sensors, drone imagery and AI – digital environmental assets and carbon accounting systems can provide real-time visibility into the effectiveness of emissions reduction and sequestration efforts [2].

</figure>

Key characteristics of DMRV that distinguish it from manual MRV include [^31]:

- [x] Digitally native platforms that can receive data from a range of sensors and data sources, including manual inputs, and automatically analyze and process data using algorithms and advanced models [^31].
- [x] Checkpoints and checklists within the platforms that ensure consistency and accuracy [^31].
- [x] A platform that can be periodically certified for use within specified project parameters this allows some project validation and verification procedures to be automated to streamline project development while ensuring integrity [^31].

## Credit Issuance 

Credit issuance is ultimately a process of (MRV) monitoring, reporting, and verification: monitoring to calculate a project’s emissions reductions (i.e., credits), reporting to document the calculations before a credit registry, and verification of the calculations by independent auditors.[^29].

DMRV platforms would modernize credit issuance in at least 4 critical ways [^29].

1.  Shift from manual data collection to satellite observation [^29].
2.  Shift from inconsistent, manual calculation to uniform, automated calculation [^29].
3.  Shift from auditing projects to certifying platforms [^29].
4.  Shift from static documents to interactive, digital visualization [^29].

## Carbon Credit

Credit registries, such as Verra, now refer to future digital crediting platforms as digital MRV (DMRV) platforms. Since our founding in 2018, Pachama has sought to lead the way in DMRV and become the first registry-certified DMRV platform. Carbon credit to calculate each term in this equation, a DMRV must produce three core outputs [29]: 

- [x] an estimate of baseline emissions [^29].
- [x] a map of forest carbon [^29].
- [x] a map of forest cover change (deforestation and/or reforestation) to know where carbon has been lost or gained [^29].

## DMRV for Renewables

CCD has developed ML-based models to estimate canopy height and above-ground biomass (AGB) over woodlands at sub-national scale. This allows for identification of forest deforestation and disturbance, and aids efforts to conserve biodiversity hotspots. CCD offers forecasting and scheduling services for independent power producers [^32].

### Data sources

SCADA systems or other third party sources; India’s Central Transmission Utility (CTU); daily generation reports (DGRs) [^32].

### Data collection

SCADA data is compared with other sources to understand the issuance of carbon credits. Real-time data is also shared daily with the Global Carbon Council (GCC), for both energy and carbon credits [^32].

### Data auditing

SCADA data is audited against other sources to identify discrepancies with meter data. This audit provides an optimised estimation of the issued carbon credits through SCADA data [^32].

Having an independent source of data (such as SCADA) to verify the amount of carbon credits being claimed by projects on a registry can significantly reduce the costs associated with verification. Another major benefit is that this can accelerate the issuance of carbon credits, allowing new issuances on a bi-annual or monthly basis rather than once a year [^32].

### Automated SDG extraction from project documents

Identifying which SDGs a project contributes to is a crucial task, and one that can be very time consuming for companies or project developers who rely solely on manual methods. However, AI can be used to intelligently extract SDGs relevant to a particular project based on the unstructured content contained in related documents (e.g. images and text). This method relies on Natural Language Processing (NLP) [^32].

CCD has conducted R&D and testing on more than 50 documents in order to develop its own NLP service. Currently, the company’s models operate with 85% accuracy, which is projected to reach 95% within the next two quarters. CCD utilises the following AI models for SDG extraction from project documents [^32]:

- [x] GPT2
- [x] All-mpnet-base-v2
- [x] All-distilroberta-v1
- [x] miniLM-L12-v2
